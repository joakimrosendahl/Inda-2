Trying multiple coding laguages (Python, Java, Javascript, C and Rust).

Using the exercises provided by KTH at the course:


Exercise 2.0 -- Fields
In the src folder, create a new class called Indamon.java. In Java, you model attributes of real-world objects with fields. The Indamon-class is supposed to have:

String name
int hp (hit points)
int attack
int defense
boolean fainted
If done correctly, the main method provided in Example 1 should compile, if added to Indamon.java.

Exercise 2.1 -- Getters and Setters
A defining concept in object-oriented programming is encapsulation. Encapsulations means preventing direct access to the state of your Indamon. This can be done by setting the access modifiers of the fields in the Indamon class to private. However, we still want to be able to read from and write to the fields. We can do this by adding accessors and mutators (so called getters and setters methods). All fields should be accompanied with getters and setters, which makes a total of ten methods! If done correctly, the provided main method in Example 2 should compile, if added to Indamon.java.

Exercise 2.2 -- Constructor
Example 2 is a bit tedious; you dont want to add attributes to each object you create in this way. Instead, you should use a constructor. Implement a constructor following the examples in the OLI material (or the Official Oracle tutorial), and repeat example 2 with this implementation.

Exercise 2.3 -- printInfo()
You want a way to print all the info about the indamon to the terminal. Take a look at Example 3 and implement a method called printInfo(). The return type should be void.
